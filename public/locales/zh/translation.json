Service Description\nPayslip Calculator is a free tool that helps Singapore-based workers estimate payslip calculations (including overtime, deductions, and allowances) and compare estimated remittance rates across providers. All calculations are performed locally in your browser.\n\n3. No Financial Advice\nThis application does not provide financial, legal, or tax advice. Payslip calculations are based on general Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM) guidelines and may not reflect your specific employment terms, collective agreements, or individual contract provisions. Always verify calculations with your employer or a qualified professional.\n\n4. Estimated Rates Only\nRemittance comparison rates displayed in this application are estimates only. They are calculated by applying approximate provider margins to mid-market exchange rates obtained from a public API. These are NOT live quotes from any remittance provider.

Third-Party Services\nThis application contains links to third-party remittance providers. We are not affiliated with, endorsed by, or responsible for any third-party service. Your use of third-party services is governed by their respective terms and conditions.\n\n6. Affiliate Relationships\nSome links to remittance providers may be affiliate links. See our Affiliate Disclosure for details. Affiliate relationships do not influence the order or presentation of provider comparisons.\n\n7.
